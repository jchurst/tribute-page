                                Nikola Tesla's lab, spring of 1894. Clemens is
                                holding Tesla's experimental vacuum lamp, which
                                is powered by a loop of wire which is receiving
                                electromagnetic energy from a Tesla coil. (Mr.

                        <p>Sam Clemens, who's pen name was "Mark Twain", was
                        born in 1835 when Halley's Comet was visible from
                        Earth, and he predicted that he would "go out with it",
                        as well. He died the day after the comet was visible
                        from Earth in 1910. He was labeled as the "greatest
                        American author and humorist of his age", and
                        Nobel/Pulitzer prize winning author William Faulkner
                        once referred to Clemens as "the father of American
                        literature".</p>
                        <p>The name ”Mark Twain" was derived from a riverboat
                        term that measured two fathoms, (12 feet) in depth:
                        mark, (measure) twain (two).</p>

                        <p>Clemens was fascinated with scientific inquiry and
                        discovery. He developed a close and lasting friendship
                        with Nikola Tesla, and the two spent much time together
                        in Tesla's laboratory. Late in life he developed a
                        relationship with Thomas Edison as well.</p>
                        <p>Clemens was in great demand as a featured speaker,
                        delivering humorous talks, very similar to what would
                        later become known as stand-up comedy. He presented to
                        many men's clubs, including the Authors' Club,
                        Beefsteak Club, Vagabonds, White Friars, and the Monday
                        Evening Club of Hartford. In the late 1890s, he spoke
                        to the Savage Club in London and was elected as an
                        honorary member. When Clemens was told that only three
                        men had received that honor, including the Prince of
                        Wales, he replied "Well, it must make the Prince feel
                        mighty fine."</p>
                        <p>Clemens became well known for his refusal to
                        compromise his principles. He was a tremendous
                        supporter of the woman suffrage movement.</p>
                        <p>In 1903 Clemens wrote a <a href=
                        "http://braillebug.afb.org/hktwain.asp" target=
                        "_blank">heart-felt letter</a> to Helen Keller which
                        resulted in a very special friendship.</p>
                        <p>Samuel Clemons Quote - "I am filled with the wonder
                        of her knowledge, acquired because shut out from all
                        distractions. If I could have been deaf, dumb, and
                        blind I also might have arrived at something."</p>

                        <p>He visited Sydney, Australia in 1895 as part of a
                        world lecture tour. In 1897, Clemens spoke to the
                        Concordia Press Club in Vienna as a special guest. To
                        the great amusement of attendees, Clemens delivered the
                        speech "Die Schrecken der deutschen Sprache" in German,
                        ("The Horrors of the German Language").</p>
                        <p>In 1901, Clemens was invited to speak at Princeton
                        University's Whig-Clio Literary Society, where he was
                        made an honorary member as well.</p>
                        <p>In 1907, Clemens received a Doctor of Letters degree
                        from Oxford University.</p>

                        <p>Clemens patented three inventions, including an
                        "Improvement in Adjustable and Detachable Straps for
                        Garments", (a replacement for suspenders), as well as a
                        history trivia game. The most successful invention was
                        a self-pasting scrapbook; a dried adhesive on the pages
                        needed only to be moistened before use, and over 25,000
                        were sold.</p>
                        <p>Clemens' novel, "A Connecticut Yankee in King
                        Arthur's Court", (1889) features a time traveler from
                        the modern US, using his knowledge of science to
                        introduce technology to the citizens of England in the
                        past. This type of storyline would later become quite
                        common in many science fiction pieces.</p>
                        <p>In 1909, Thomas Edison requested to visit Clemens at
                        his home in Redding, Connecticut to film him. Part of
                        the footage was used in "The Prince and the Pauper"
                        (1909), a short film.</p>
